An educational web application built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)** that visualises future pension benefits for people entering the labour market in Poland.  
It implements the ZUS Hackathon requirements, including the basic simulator, advanced dashboard for deeper forecasting, and accessibility/WCAG compliance.

  Responsive layouts, ZUS brand palette, gradients and accessible focus rings.

  * Visualise how your ZUS account/sub-account grows over the years.  
  * See advanced nominal, real and replacement rate values.

- **Downloadable Report (spec 1.5)**  
  Generate a PDF with the input parameters, charts and calculated forecast.

- **User Profiles**  
  * Anonymous or Google login via Firebase Authentication.  
  * Logged-in users can save forecasts to the cloud (Firestore).  
  * Profile page shows saved scenarios, gamified tips & goals.

- **Admin Page**  
  * View and export user forecasts to XLSX.  
  * Filter only logged-in users‚Äô data.  

- **AI Assistant**  
  Floating üí¨ icon on every page opens an assistant trained to answer retirement questions and explain the replacement rate.  
  Uses GPT model API for responses and `react-markdown` to render formatted answers.

- **Accessibility**  
  Complies with WCAG 2.0 AA contrast.  
  Keyboard-focusable controls and visible focus rings.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run locally
npm run dev

# build production
npm run build && npm start
```

## üîë Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with your Firebase config:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
```

## üìú Notes

- This simulator is educational. It uses simplified assumptions (average indexation, constant contribution rate, 20-year life expectancy) and defaults to the current Polish statutory retirement age (60 women, 65 men).

- Real ZUS calculations are more complex and include official life-expectancy tables, indexing rules and special cases.

## üèÜ Hackathon Goal

Provide an accessible, visually appealing and interactive pension forecast tool that increases awareness of future retirement benefits and promotes better savings habits among young workers.
